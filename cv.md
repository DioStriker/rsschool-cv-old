## PROFILE

I am 38 years old, I've graduated from Saint-Petersburg University of Civil Aviation in 2006 with Bachelor's degree in Organizational Management, and for the past 9 years I was working as a flight attendant. My English level is B2 Upper-Intermediate, I have developed somewhat high social skills thanks to my previous profession. As I felt I'd been sitting for too long on the same spot, I decided to change my occupation and a dive into Frond-End development. I'm a kind of person that sets and tries to archive new goals, and I am full of determination to do my best and accomplish them.
